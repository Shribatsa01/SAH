        The Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) is a centre of excellence providing in-depth technical knowledge and opportunities for innovation and research with up-to-date computing facilities. The departmentâ€™s mission is to provide a positive and professional learning environment to master the fundamental principles of computing and problem solving skills to build the intellectual capital of the society.
      </p>
       <p>
        Computer Science Engineering (CSE) encompasses a variety of topics that relates to computation, like analysis of algorithms, programming languages, program design, software, and computer hardware. Computer Science engineering has roots in electrical engineering, mathematics, and linguistics. In the past Computer Science was taught as part of mathematics or engineering departments & in the recent days it has emerged as a separate engineering field
      </p>
       <p>
        The department was established in the academic year 1997-98 with an annual intake of 40. The intake was increased to 60 in the academic year 1999, subsequently to 90 in 2001. Afterwards, the intake was increased to 120 in 2006. The department is accredited by NBA (National Board of Accreditation, AICTE, Delhi). The department intake was increased to 180 from the academic year 2011-2012. Seventeen batches of students have graduated so far. The departments is also offering M.Tech,MCA,BCA course in Computer Science & Engineering
      </p>
       <p>
        VISION:-To be globally acclaimed as a premier Computer Science and Engineering departments through excellent teaching and strong research environment by creating professionally competent engineers with moral values committed to build a vibrant nation.
      </p>
       <p>
        MISSION:-Provide a positive and professional learning environment to master the fundamental principles of computing, problem solving skills, leadership qualities, team-spirit, ethics and societal responsibilities.To enable the graduates to use modern tools and technologies in the area of computer science and information technology.To promote innovative research in computer science and engineering to serve the needs of industry, government and society at large.
