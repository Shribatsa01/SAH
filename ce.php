        Civil Engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like roads, bridges, canals, dams, and buildings. The departments is supported by well qualified, experienced teaching staff from various streams of Civil Engineering like Structures, Geo technical, Environmental, Transportation, Hydraulics and Irrigation, Engg. The departments of Civil Engineering was started in the year 2009 with an intake of 60 students. The Institution has a separate block used for Civil departments with spacious classrooms and laboratories. The departments is well equipped with modern machines and equipments to impart practical knowledge to students. Seven batches of students have graduated so far. The departments is also offering M.Tech course in Structural Engineering.
